He also performed some mild calculations on the paper. Since coming up with the idea, Doc spent many years and most of his family fortune trying to get it to work.  By 1962, he had invented the temporal field capacitor. It was a prototype time machine that was able to send objects through time, but only during the lifespan of the device. It could only send objects forward through time, as sending objects even a few minutes into the past would cause a buildup of flux energy. If an object was sent any further back than that, the arrival of the object would overheat the capacitor and start an electrical fire. The problem with the build-up of flux energy was solved by the flux capacitor, allowing time travel to the future, as well as the past.', city='Hill Valley', state='California', country='USA', month='November', day=5, year='1955', price=450))
